### Cliff Jumper Guidelines

There are a number of guidelines considered when reviewing Pull Requests to be
merged. _This is by no means an exhaustive list, but here are some things to
consider before/while submitting your ideas._

- Everything in Cliff Jumper should be generally useful for the majority of
  users. Don't let that stop you if you've got a good concept though, as your
  idea still might be a great addition.
- Everything should follow our ESLint rules as closely as possible, and should
  pass linting even if you must disable a rule for a single line.
- Scripts that are to be ran outside of the scope of the bot should be added to
  [scripts] directory and should be in the `.mjs` file format.
